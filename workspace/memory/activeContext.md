# Active Context: Current Work

## Current Focus
[2026-02-20 11:00] - Planning restructured. Created A0-prerequisites.md for manual setup. Split implementation into 3 focused plans: A2 (foundation/polling), A3 (Shopify integration), A4 (testing/docs). Changed to polling-based approach for local development. User needs to complete A0-prerequisites before implementation can begin.

## Immediate Goals
- User completes A0-prerequisites.md (Shopify app, Sevdesk API key, local PostgreSQL)
- Execute A2-plan.md (project foundation)
- Execute A3-plan.md (Shopify integration)
- Execute A4-plan.md (testing & documentation)
